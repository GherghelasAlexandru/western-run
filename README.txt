Please install the ARCADECLASSIC.TTF font from  Wester Run/assets/fonts.

The game is not resizable so playing in Full Screen mode is recomanded.

The character is tricky, 
sometimes if you spam the space bar you can make him fly, but be carefull, doing that can end your game earlier.

Enjoy and try to beat my score!
